what I want to do in this video is give a very high-level overview of the four fundamental forces four fundamental forces of the universe and I'm going to start with gravity I'm going to start with gravity and it might surprise some of you that gravity is actually the weakest of the four fundamental forces that's surprising because you say wow that's what keeps us glued not glued but it keeps us from jumping off the planet it's what keeps the moon in orbit around the earth the earth in orbit around the Sun the Sun in orbit around the the center of the Milky Way galaxy so it's

pretty hairy but I just want to give you an example of what the weak interaction does so if one of these one of these neutrons turns into a proton then we're going to have one extra proton but we have the same number of nucleons instead of a extra Neutron here you now have an extra proton here and so now this is a different atom it is now barium and in that flipping it will actually emit it'll actually emit an electron and an anti-electron neutrino and I'm not going to go into the details of what an anti-electron neutrino is these are fundamental particles but this is just 	
an example of what the weak interaction does so if one of these one of these neutrons turns into a proton then we're going to have one extra proton but we have the same number of nucleons instead of a extra Neutron here you now have an extra proton here and so now this is a different atom it is now barium and in that flipping it will actually emit it'll actually emit an electron and an anti-electron neutrino and I'm not going to go into the details of what an anti-electron neutrino is these are fundamental particles but this is just what that weak interaction is it's not 	
does so if one of these one of these neutrons turns into a proton then we're going to have one extra proton but we have the same number of nucleons instead of a extra Neutron here you now have an extra proton here and so now this is a different atom it is now barium and in that flipping it will actually emit it'll actually emit an electron and an anti-electron neutrino and I'm not going to go into the details of what an anti-electron neutrino is these are fundamental particles but this is just what that weak interaction is it's not something that's completely obvious to 	
neutrons turns into a proton then we're going to have one extra proton but we have the same number of nucleons instead of a extra Neutron here you now have an extra proton here and so now this is a different atom it is now barium and in that flipping it will actually emit it'll actually emit an electron and an anti-electron neutrino and I'm not going to go into the details of what an anti-electron neutrino is these are fundamental particles but this is just what that weak interaction is it's not something that's completely obvious to us it's not kind of this traditional 	
going to have one extra proton but we have the same number of nucleons instead of a extra Neutron here you now have an extra proton here and so now this is a different atom it is now barium and in that flipping it will actually emit it'll actually emit an electron and an anti-electron neutrino and I'm not going to go into the details of what an anti-electron neutrino is these are fundamental particles but this is just what that weak interaction is it's not something that's completely obvious to us it's not kind of this traditional things pulling or pushing away from each 	
have the same number of nucleons instead of a extra Neutron here you now have an extra proton here and so now this is a different atom it is now barium and in that flipping it will actually emit it'll actually emit an electron and an anti-electron neutrino and I'm not going to go into the details of what an anti-electron neutrino is these are fundamental particles but this is just what that weak interaction is it's not something that's completely obvious to us it's not kind of this traditional things pulling or pushing away from each other like we would like we associate
