what I want to do in this video is give
00:01
a very high-level overview of the four
00:04
fundamental forces four fundamental
00:07
forces of the universe and I'm going to
00:09
start with gravity I'm going to start
00:12
with gravity and it might surprise some
00:15
of you that gravity is actually the
00:17
weakest of the four fundamental forces
00:19
that's surprising because you say wow
00:21
that's what keeps us glued not glued but
00:23
it keeps us from jumping off the planet
00:25
it's what keeps the moon in orbit around
00:27
the earth the earth in orbit around the
00:29
Sun the Sun in orbit around the the
00:33
center of the Milky Way galaxy so it's
00:35
it's a little bit surprising that it's
00:37
actually the weakest of the forces and
00:39
and that starts to make sense when you
00:42
actually think about things on maybe
00:44
more of a human scale or a molecular
00:46
scale or even an atomic scale even on a
00:48
human scale your computer monitor and
00:51
you have some type of gravitational
00:53
attraction but you don't notice it or
00:55
your cell phone and your wallet there's
00:57
gravitational attraction but you don't
00:58
see them being drawn to each other the
01:00
way you might see two magnets drawn to
01:03
each other or repelled from each other
01:04
and if you've got even a smaller scale
01:06
you'll see that it matters even less we
01:08
never even talk about gravity and
01:10
chemistry although the gravity is there
01:12
but at those scales the other forces
01:14
really really really start to dominate
01:16
so gravity's are weakest so if we move
01:19
up a little bit from that we get and
01:22
this is maybe the the hardest force for
01:25
us to visualize or at least the hardest
01:27
the least intuitive force for me is
01:30
actually the weak force the weak
01:33
sometimes called the weak interaction
01:37
and it's what's responsible for
01:39
radioactive decay in particular beta
01:42
minus and beta plus decay and just to
01:44
give you an example of the actual weak
01:46
interaction if I had some cesium 137 137
01:52
means it has 137 nucleons a nucleon is
01:56
either a proton or a neutron you add up
01:58
the protons and neutrons of cesium you
02:00
get 137 and it is cesium because it has
02:03
exactly 55 protons now the weak
02:07
interaction is what's responsible for
02:09
one of the neutrons
02:11
essentially one of its corks flipping
02:13
and turning into a proton and I'm not
02:15
going to go into detail of what a cork
02:16
is and all of that and the math can get
02:18
pretty hairy but I just want to give you
02:21
an example of what the weak interaction
02:22
does so if one of these one of these
02:24
neutrons turns into a proton then we're
02:26
going to have one extra proton but we
02:29
have the same number of nucleons instead
02:32
of a extra Neutron here you now have an
02:34
extra proton here and so now this is a
02:37
different atom it is now barium and in
02:40
that flipping it will actually emit
02:42
it'll actually emit an electron and an
02:47
anti-electron neutrino and I'm not going
02:50
to go into the details of what an
02:52
anti-electron neutrino is these are
02:54
fundamental particles but this is just
02:57
what that weak interaction is it's not
02:58
something that's completely obvious to
03:00
us it's not kind of this traditional
03:02
things pulling or pushing away from each
03:05
other like we would like we associate
03:07
with the other the other forces now the
03:10
next strongest force and just to give a
03:11
sense of how weak gravity is even
03:14
relative to the weak interaction the
03:18
weak interaction is 10 to the 25th times
03:22
the strength of gravity times the
03:25
strength of gravity and you might
03:27
anything if this is so strong how come
03:29
this doesn't operate on planets or us
03:31
relative to the earth or the reason you
03:35
know why doesn't this apply to
03:37
intergalactic distances the way gravity
03:39
does and the reason is the weak
03:41
interaction really applies to very small
03:44
distances very very small distances so
03:50
it can be much stronger than gravity but
03:53
only over very very and it really only
03:55
applies on the sub atomic scale you go
03:57
anything beyond that it kind of
03:59
disappears as an actual force as an
04:02
actual interaction now the next the next
04:04
force up the hierarchy which is one that
04:08
we are more familiar with it is
04:09
something it's what actually dominates
04:11
most of the chemistry that we deal with
04:14
and electromagnetism that we deal with
04:17
and that's the electro magnetic force we
04:20
write it in magenta electro
04:24
magnetic magnetic force and just to give
04:30
a sense this is this is 10 to the 36
04:34
times the strength of gravity 10 to 36
04:37
times the strength of gravity so it kind
04:38
of puts the weak force in its place it's
04:40
10 to the 12 times stronger than the
04:42
weak force so these are huge numbers
04:43
that we're talking about either this
04:44
relative that or even this relative to
04:47
gravity and so you might be saying well
04:49
you know the electromagnetic force
04:51
that's unbelievably strong why doesn't
04:53
that apply over over over these these
04:57
kind of macro scales like gravity let me
04:59
write there macro scales macro scales
05:03
why doesn't it apply to macro scales and
05:05
actually there's nothing about the
05:07
electromagnetic force why it can't it or
05:09
it actually does apply over large
05:12
distances the reality though is you
05:14
don't have these huge concentrations of
05:16
either electric Ullom charges or
05:20
magnetism the way you do mass so the
05:24
mass that you have such huge
05:25
concentrations it can operate over huge
05:27
huge distances even though it's way way
05:29
way weaker than the electromagnetic
05:32
force the electromagnetic force what
05:34
happens is because it's both attractive
05:36
and repulsive it tends to kind of sort
05:38
itself out so you don't have these huge
05:40
huge huge concentrations of charge now
05:43
the other thing you might be wondering
05:44
about is you know why is it called the
05:46
electromagnetic force in our everyday
05:48
life there's things like there's things
05:50
like the Coulomb force that or the
05:52
electrostatic force which we're familiar
05:55
with positive charges or like charges
05:58
want to repel if both of these were
06:00
negative the same thing would be
06:01
happening and different charges like to
06:04
attract we've seen this multiple times
06:07
this is the Coulomb force or the
06:09
electrostatic force electro static and
06:12
then on the other side of the word yes
06:16
you have the magnetic part and magnets
06:18
you know you have you've played with
06:19
magnets on your fridge they what's what
06:21
you know if they're the same side of the
06:23
magnet they're going to repel each other
06:25
if they're the opposite sides opposite
06:26
poles they're going to attract each
06:28
other so why is it called one force and
06:30
it's called one force and once again I'm
06:32
not going to go into detail here it's
06:34
called one force because it turns out
06:37
that the cool
06:38
force the electrostatic force and the
06:40
magnetic force are actually the same
06:42
thing viewed in different frames of
06:45
references so I won't go into a lot of
06:47
detail but just keep that in the back of
06:49
your mind that they are connected in a
06:50
future video I'll go more into the
06:52
intuition of how they are connected and
06:54
it deals with when what it's more
06:57
apparent when they're moving when the
06:59
charges are moving at relativistic
07:00
frames and you have well I will go to a
07:04
lot of detail there but just keep in
07:05
mind that they really are the same force
07:07
just viewed from different frames of
07:10
reference now the strongest of the force
07:12
is probably the best name of them all
07:15
and that's the strong force that is the
07:20
strong force the strong force and
07:24
although you probably haven't seen this
07:26
yet in our in chemistry classes it
07:28
actually applies very strongly in
07:29
chemistry because from the get-go when
07:31
you first learn when you first learn
07:33
about atoms let me draw a helium atom a
07:35
helium atom has two protons and it's
07:39
nucleus two protons in its nucleus and
07:42
it has two neutrons and then it also has
07:46
two electrons circulating around so it
07:47
has an electron and I can draw the
07:49
electrons is much smaller than well I
07:51
won't I won't try to do anything in
07:53
relative size but it has two electrons
07:54
floating around and one question that
07:56
may or may not have jumped into your
07:58
mind when you first saw this model of an
08:01
atom is like well I see why the
08:03
electrons are attracted to the nucleus
08:05
it has a negative Coulomb charge the
08:07
nucleus has a net positive Coulomb
08:09
charge but what's not so obvious and
08:11
that what tends not to sometimes be
08:13
explained in chemistry class is these
08:15
two positive charges are sitting right
08:16
next to each other if the
08:18
electromagnetic force was the only force
08:20
in play if the Coulomb force was the
08:22
only thing happening these guys would
08:24
just run away from each other they would
08:26
repel each other and so the only reason
08:28
why they're able to stick to each other
08:30
is that there's an even stronger force
08:33
than the electromagnetic force operating
08:35
at these very very very small distances
08:37
so if you get two of these protons close
08:40
enough together and the strong force
08:42
only applies over very very very small
08:45
distances subatomic I should even say
08:47
sub nucleic distances then
08:51
the strong interaction comes into play
08:53
so then you have the strong interaction
08:55
actually keeping these charges together
08:57
and once again just to keep it in in in
09:00
mind relative to gravity it is 10 to the
09:03
38th 10 38 times the strength times the
09:08
strength of gravity or it's about a
09:09
hundred times stronger than the
09:11
electromagnetic force so once again the
09:13
reason why you don't see the strong
09:15
force which is the strongest of all of
09:16
the forces or the weak interaction
09:18
applying over huge scales is that they
09:20
really only they only their strength
09:23
dies off super super fast even when you
09:25
start going to large radius nucleuses of
09:28
atoms they strength starts to die off
09:30
especially for the strong force the
09:32
reason why you don't see the
09:33
electromagnetic force operating over
09:35
large distances even though in theory it
09:37
can like gravity is that you don't see
09:40
the type of charge concentrations the
09:42
way you see mass concentrations in the
09:44
universe because the charge
09:45
concentrations tend to sort them out
09:47
they start to equalize if I have if I
09:50
have some if I have some positive a huge
09:53
positive charge there and a huge
09:55
negative charge there they will attract
09:58
each other and then become essentially a
10:01
big lump of neutral charge and once
10:04
they're a big lump of neutral charge
10:05
they won't they won't interact with
10:07
anything else in gravity if you have one
10:09
mass and another mass and they attract
10:11
each other then you have another mass
10:14
that's even better to attracting each
10:15
other at other masses and so it'll keep
10:17
attracting things to it so it kind of
10:20
snowballs the process and that's why
10:22
gravity can operates on these really
10:24
really large large objects in our
10:26
universe in the universe as a whole
