00:00
let's imagine we have a huge cloud of
00:02
hydrogen atoms floating in space Hugh
00:05
and I say huge cloud huge both in
00:07
distance and in mass if you were to
00:09
combine all of the hydrogen atoms it
00:11
would just be this really really massive
00:14
thing so you have this huge cloud well
00:16
we know that gravity would make the
00:19
atoms actually attracted to each other
00:21
instantly we normally don't think about
00:23
the gravity of atoms but it would slowly
00:25
affect these atoms and they'd slowly
00:28
draw close to each other it would slowly
00:30
condense they'd slowly they slowly move
00:33
towards the center of mass of all of the
00:36
atoms
00:36
they'd slowly move in and so if we fast
00:39
forward if we fast forward this cloud is
00:42
going to get denser and denser it's
00:45
going to get denser and denser and the
00:46
hydrogen atoms are going to start
00:48
bumping into each other and rubbing up
00:50
against each other and interacting with
00:52
each other and so it's going to get
00:53
denser and denser and denser and
00:56
remember was a huge mass of hydrogen
00:57
atoms so the temperature is going up the
01:00
temperature is going up and it'll
01:03
they'll keep condensing they'll just
01:05
keep condensing and condensing until
01:08
something really interesting happens so
01:09
let's imagine that they've gotten really
01:11
dense here in the center they've gotten
01:14
really dense here in the center and
01:16
there's a bunch of hydrogen atoms all
01:18
over it's really dense I could never
01:20
draw the actual number of atoms here
01:22
this is really give you an idea there's
01:23
a huge amount of inward pressure from
01:27
gravity from everything that wants to
01:29
get to that center of mass of our entire
01:31
cloud the temperature here the
01:34
temperature here is approaching 10
01:36
million Kelvin and at that point
01:39
something neat happens it to kind of
01:41
realize the neat thing that's happening
01:43
let's remember what a hydrogen atom
01:45
looks like a hydrogen and even more I'm
01:47
just going to focus on the hydrogen
01:48
nucleus so the hydrogen nucleus is a
01:50
proton if you want to think about a
01:51
hydrogen atom it also has an electron
01:53
orbiting around or floating around and
01:56
let's draw another hydrogen atom over
01:59
here and obviously this distance isn't
02:00
to scale this distance is also not to
02:03
scale atoms are actually the nucleus of
02:05
atoms are actually much much much much
02:07
smaller than the actual radius of an
02:09
atom and so is the electron but anyway
02:11
this just gives you an idea
02:12
so we know from the Coulomb forces from
02:14
electromagnetic forces that these two
02:16
positively charged nucleus is will not
02:19
want to get anywhere near each other but
02:22
we do know from ours from what we
02:24
learned about the four force is that if
02:26
they did get close enough to each other
02:27
that if they did get if somehow they're
02:29
under huge temperatures and huge
02:31
pressures you were able to get these two
02:34
protons close enough to each other then
02:36
all of a sudden the strong force will
02:38
overtake it's much stronger than the
02:40
Coulomb force and that these two
02:42
hydrogen's will actually these this
02:44
these nucleuses would actually fuse or
02:47
that nuclei well anyway they would
02:49
actually fuse together and so that is
02:51
what actually happens once this gets hot
02:55
and dense enough you now have enough
02:58
pressure enough temperature to overcome
03:00
the Coulomb force and bring these
03:02
protons close enough to each other for
03:04
fusion to occur for fusion fusion
03:09
ignition ignition and the reason why is
03:12
and I want to be very careful it's not
03:14
ignition it's not combustion in the
03:16
traditional sense it's not like you're
03:17
burning a carbon molecule with out in
03:21
the presence of oxygen it's not
03:22
combustion it's ignition and the reason
03:25
why it's called ignition is because when
03:26
two of these protons or two of the
03:28
nucleus is fuse the resulting the
03:31
resulting nucleus has a slightly smaller
03:33
mass and so in the first stage of this
03:36
you actually have you actually have two
03:38
protons two protons under enough
03:41
pressure obviously this would not happen
03:43
with just the Coulomb forces at with
03:45
enough pressure to get close enough and
03:46
then the strong interaction actually
03:48
actually keeps them together one of
03:51
these guys degrades in a neutron
03:53
degrades into a neutron and the
03:57
resulting mass of the combined protons
03:59
is lower than the mass of each of the
04:01
original by a little bit but that a
04:03
little bit of mass results in a lot of
04:05
energy plus plus energy and this energy
04:11
is why we call it ignition and so what
04:14
this energy does is it provides a little
04:16
bit of outward pressure so that this
04:18
thing doesn't keep keep collapsing so
04:21
once you get pressure enough the fusion
04:23
occurs and then that energy provides
04:25
outward pressure to
04:26
what is now a star what is now a star so
04:30
now we are at where we actually have the
04:32
ignition at the center we have and we
04:36
still have all of the other molecules
04:37
trying to get in providing the pressure
04:40
for this fusion ignition now what is the
04:44
hydrogen being fused into well on the
04:46
first step of the first step of the
04:49
reaction and I'm just kind of doing the
04:51
most basic type of fusion that exhibit
04:54
ours
04:55
the hydrogen gets fused into deuterium
04:58
deuterium of trouble spelling which is
05:01
another way of calling heavy hydrogen
05:03
this is still hydrogen because it has
05:04
one proton and one Neutron now it is not
05:07
helium yet it does not have two it does
05:10
not have two protons but then the
05:12
deuterium keeps fusing and then we
05:14
eventually end up with and then we end
05:18
up with helium and we can even see that
05:19
on the periodic table I lost my periodic
05:21
table well I'll show you in the next
05:22
video but we know hydrogen hydrogen
05:25
hydrogen in its atomic state has an
05:30
atomic number of one and it also has a
05:33
mass of one it only has one nucleon and
05:36
it's nucleus but it's being fused it
05:39
goes to hydrogen too which is deuterium
05:41
which is one Neutron one proton in its
05:44
nucleus two nucleons and then that
05:47
eventually gets fused and I'm not going
05:48
to the detail of the reaction into
05:50
helium and by definition helium has two
05:53
protons and two neutrons so it has or
05:56
we're talking about helium four in
05:58
particular that isotope of helium it has
06:00
an atomic mass of four and the whole
06:03
this process releases a ton of energy
06:05
because the atomic mass of the helium
06:08
that gets produced is slightly lower
06:10
than four of its of the atomic four
06:13
times the atomic mass of each of the
06:15
Constituent hydrogen's so all of this
06:18
energy all of this energy from the
06:20
fusion but it needs super high pressure
06:23
super high temperatures to happen keeps
06:25
keeps the star from collapsing and once
06:29
the star is in in this stage once it is
06:32
once it is using hydrogen it is fusing
06:35
hydrogen in its core where the pressure
06:36
and the temperatures of most to form
06:38
helium it is now in its main
06:40
sequence this is now a main sequence
06:42
star main main sequence star and that's
06:48
actually where the Sun is right now now
06:50
there's there's questions of well what
06:52
if what if there just wasn't enough mass
06:54
to get to this level over here and there
06:56
actually are things that never get to
06:58
that quite that threshold to fuse all
07:00
the way into helium there are a few
07:01
things that don't quite make the
07:02
threshold of stars that only fuse to
07:04
this level so they are generating some
07:05
of their eat or there are even smaller
07:07
objects that just get to the point
07:10
there's a huge temperature and pressure
07:12
but fusion is not actually occurring
07:13
inside of the core and something like
07:15
Jupiter would be an example and you can
07:17
go several several masses above Jupiter
07:20
where you get something like that so you
07:21
have to reach a certain threshold or the
07:22
mass where the pressure and the
07:24
temperature due to the heavy mass gets
07:26
so large that you start this fusion at
07:28
but the smaller you have above that
07:31
threshold this the slower the fusion
07:33
will occur but if you're supermassive
07:34
the fusion will occur really really fast
07:37
so that's a general idea of just how
07:39
stars get formed and why they don't
07:41
collapse on themselves and why they are
07:44
these kind of little balls of fusion
07:47
reactions existing in the universe and
07:48
the next few videos we'll talk about
07:50
what happens once that hydrogen fuel and
07:52
the cure in the core starts to run out
