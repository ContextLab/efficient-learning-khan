force in its place it's 10 to the 12 times stronger than the weak force so these are huge numbers that we're talking about either this relative that or even this relative to gravity and so you might be saying well you know the electromagnetic force that's unbelievably strong why doesn't that apply over over over these these kind of macro scales like gravity let me write there macro scales macro scales why doesn't it apply to macro scales and actually there's nothing about the electromagnetic force why it can't it or it actually does apply over large distances the reality though is you don't have these huge concentrations of either electric Ullom charges or magnetism the way you do mass so the mass that you have such huge concentrations it can operate over huge huge distances even though it's way way way weaker than the electromagnetic force the electromagnetic force what happens is because it's both attractive and repulsive it tends to kind of sort itself out so you don't have these huge huge huge concentrations of charge now the other thing you might be wondering about is you know why is it called the electromagnetic force in our everyday life there's things like there's things like the Coulomb force that or the electrostatic force which we're familiar...\\newline\\textbf{[06:37.31--07:28.1]} ...that the cool force the electrostatic force and the magnetic force are actually the same thing viewed in different frames of references so I won't go into a lot of detail but just keep that in the back of your mind that they are connected in a future video I'll go more into the intuition of how they are connected and it deals with when what it's more apparent when they're moving when the charges are moving at relativistic frames and you have well I will go to a lot of detail there but just keep in mind that they really are the same force just viewed from different frames of reference now the strongest of the force is probably the best name of them all and that's the strong force that is the strong force the strong force and although you probably haven't seen this yet in our in chemistry classes it actually applies very strongly in... \\\\\\hline\n",
