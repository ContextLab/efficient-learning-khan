# About jsPsych

jsPsych was created by [Josh de Leeuw](http://www.twitter.com/joshdeleeuw). There have been [many other contributors](https://github.com/jodeleeuw/jsPsych/blob/master/contributors.md) to the library; thanks to all of them!

### Citation

If you use jsPsych for academic work please cite the following paper.

### Response times

Wondering if jsPsych can be used for research that depends on accurate response time measurement? For most purposes, the answer is yes. Response time measurements in jsPsych (and JavaScript in general) are comparable to those taken in standard lab software like Psychophysics Toolbox and E-Prime. Response times measured in JavaScript tend to be a little bit longer (10-40ms), but have similar variance. See the following references for extensive work on this topic.
