# Support

For questions about jsPsych the preferred method of support is the [jsPsych Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jspsych). Questions are most likely to be answered when they include a reproducible example of the problem. If you can make your code available online and link to the experiment, that will make the question easier to answer.

If you have identified a problem with jsPsych, such as a bug in the code or an error in the documentation, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/jodeleeuw/jsPsych/issues) on the GitHub site.

Inquiries for paid consultation to develop experiments using jsPsych or to create new custom jsPsych features can be sent to [josh.deleeuw@gmail.com](mailto:josh.deleeuw@gmail.com).
