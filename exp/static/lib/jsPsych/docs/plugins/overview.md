# Plugins

In jsPsych, plugins define the kinds of tasks that subjects perform in experiments. Some plugins define very general tasks, like displaying instructions or displaying a visual stimulus and getting a keyboard response. Other plugins are more specific, displaying particular kinds of interactive stimuli, or running a specific version of particular kind of task. Creating an experiment with jsPsych involves figuring out which plugins are needed for the kinds of tasks you want to have your subjects perform.

Plugins provide a structure for a particular task, but often allow for significant customization and flexibility. For example, the `jspsych-image-keyboard-response` plugin defines a simple structure for showing an image and collecting a keyboard response. You can specify the what the stimulus is, what keys the subject is allowed to press, and how long the stimulus should be on the screen, how long the subject has to respond, and so on. Many of these content options have reasonable default values; even though the `jspsych-image-keyboard-response` plugin has many different options, you only *need* to specify the stimulus in order to use it. Each plugin has its own documentation page, which describes what the plugin does and what options are available.

## Using a plugin

To use a plugin, you'll need to load the plugin's JavaScript file on your experiment page:

```html
<head>
<script src="jspsych/plugins/jspsych-image-keyboard-response.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</head>
```

Once a plugin is loaded, you can define a trial that uses that plugin. The following JavaScript code defines a trial using the `jspsych-image-keyboard-response` plugin to display an image file ('images/happy_face.jpg'). This trial uses the default values for valid keys, length of display, and other parameters. You could override these values by adding them to the object.

```javascript
var single_stim_trial = {
	type: 'image-keyboard-response',
	stimulus: 'images/happy_face.jpg'
}
```

Here's an exampe of overriding the default value for `post_trial_gap`:

```javascript
var single_stim_trial = {
	type: 'image-keyboard-response',
	stimulus: 'images/happy_face.jpg',
	post_trial_gap: 2000
}
```

## Parameters available in all plugins

Each plugin specifies its own set of parameters. Check the documentation for a plugin to see what parameters are available and what they do.

In addition, there is a set of parameters that can be specified for any plugin.

Parameter | Type | Default Value | Description
----------|------|---------------|------------
post_trial_gap | numeric | null | Sets the time, in milliseconds, between the current trial and the next trial. If null, there will be no gap.
on_finish | function | `function(){ return; }` | A callback function to execute when the trial finishes. See [this page](../overview/callbacks.md) for more details.
on_start | function | `function(){ return; }` | A callback function to execute when the trial begins, before any loading has occurred. See [this page](../overview/callbacks.md) for more details.
on_load | function | `function(){ return; }` | A callback function to execute when the trial has loaded, which typically happens after the initial display of the plugin has loaded. See [this page](../overview/callbacks.md) for more details.
data | object | *undefined* | An object containing additional data to store for the trial. See [this page](../overview/data.md) for more details.

## Data collected by plugins

Each plugin defines what data is collected on the trial. The documentation for each plugin specifies what data is collected by that plugin.

In addition to the data collected by a plugin, there is a default set of data that is collected on every trial. The collected data are:

Name | Type | Value
-----|------|------
trial_type | string | The name of the plugin used to run the trial.
trial_index | numeric | The index of the current trial across the whole experiment.
time_elapsed | numeric | The number of milliseconds since the start of the experiment when the trial ended.
internal_node_id | string | A string identifier for the current TimelineNode.

Doesn't display anything to the subject, and the subject is usually unaware that this plugin has even executed. It's useful for performing tasks at specified times in the experiment, such as saving data.
[jspsych&#8209;categorize&#8209;animation](jspsych-categorize-animation) | The subject responds to an animation and can be given feedback about their response.
