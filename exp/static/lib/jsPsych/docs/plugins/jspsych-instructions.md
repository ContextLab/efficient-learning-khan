# jspsych-instructions plugin

This plugin is for showing instructions to the subject. It allows subjects to navigate through multiple pages of instructions at their own pace, recording how long the subject spends on each page. Navigation can be done using the mouse or keyboard. Subjects can be allowed to navigate forwards and backwards through pages, if desired.

## Parameters

Parameters with a default value of *undefined* must be specified. Other parameters can be left unspecified if the default value is acceptable.

Parameter | Type | Default Value | Description
----------|------|---------------|------------
pages | array | *undefined* | Each element of the array is the content for a single page. Each page should be an HTML-formatted string.
key_forward | key code | 'rightarrow' | This is the key that the subject can press in order to advance to the next page. Keys can be specified as their [numeric key code](http://www.cambiaresearch.com/articles/15/javascript-char-codes-key-codes) or as characters (e.g., `'a'`, `'q'`).
key_backward | key code | 'leftarrow' | This is the key that the subject can press to return to the previous page.
allow_backward | boolean | true | If true, the subject can return to previous pages of the instructions. If false, they may only advace to the next page.
allow_keys | boolean | true | If true, the subject can use keyboard keys to navigate the pages. If false, they may not.
show_clickable_nav | boolean | false | If true, then a `Previous` and `Next` button will be displayed beneath the instructions. Subjects can click the buttons to navigate.
button_label_previous | string | 'Previous' | The text that appears on the button to go backwards.
button_label_next | string | 'Next' | The text that appears on the button to go forwards.

Name | Type | Value
-----|------|------
view_history | JSON string | A JSON string containing the order of pages the subject viewed (including when the subject returned to previous pages) and the time spent viewing each page.
rt | numeric | The response time in milliseconds for the subject to view all of the pages.

		'This is the second page of instructions.',
		'This is the final page.'
	],
	show_clickable_nav: true
}
```

#### Including images

```javascript
var trial = {
	type: 'instructions',
	pages: [
