00:00.294
What I want to do in this video is
00:01.71
give a very high-level overview of the four fundamental forces
00:08.16
of the universe.
00:09.28
And I'm going to start with gravity.
00:14.21
And it might surprise some of you that gravity is actually
00:17.31
the weakest of the four fundamental forces.
00:19.64
And that's surprising because you say, wow,
00:21.59
that's what keeps us glued-- not glued-- but it keeps us
00:24.22
from jumping off the planet.
00:25.8
It's what keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth,
00:28.22
the Earth in orbit around the Sun, the Sun in orbit
00:31.77
around the center of the Milky Way galaxy.
00:35.29
So if it's a little bit surprising
00:36.97
that it's actually the weakest of the forces.
00:39.81
And that starts to make sense when you actually
00:43.11
think about things on maybe more of a human scale,
00:45.46
or a molecular scale, or even atomic scale.
00:47.84
Even on a human scale, your computer monitor and you,
00:52.19
have some type of gravitational attraction.
00:54.29
But you don't notice it.
00:55.54
Or your cell phone and your wallet, there's
00:57.45
gravitational attraction.
00:58.59
But you don't see them being drawn to each other the way
01:00.923
you might see two magnets drawn to each other
01:03.83
or repelled from each other.
01:05.14
And if you go to even a smaller scale,
01:06.723
you'll see the it matters even less.
01:08.8
We never even talk about gravity in chemistry,
01:10.84
although the gravity is there.
01:12.95
But at those scales, the other forces really,
01:15.37
really, really start to dominate.
01:17.58
So gravity is our weakest.
01:19.02
So if we move up a little bit from that,
01:21.95
we get-- and this is maybe the hardest force for us
01:25.51
to visualize.
01:27.19
Or it's, at least, the least intuitive force for me--
01:30.54
is actually the weak force, sometimes called
01:34.82
the weak interaction.
01:38.21
And it's what's responsible for radioactive decay,
01:41.25
in particular beta minus and beta plus decay.
01:43.85
And just to give you an example of the actual weak interaction,
01:47.72
if I had some cesium-137-- 137 means it has 137 nucleons.
01:55.66
A nucleon is either a proton or a neutron.
01:58.23
You add up the protons and neutrons of cesium,
02:00.31
you get 137.
02:01.97
And it is cesium, because it has exactly 55 protons.
02:07.301
Now, the weak interaction is what's
02:08.759
responsible for one of the neutrons-- essentially
02:12.26
one of its quarks flipping and turning into a proton.
02:14.69
And I'm not going to go into detail of what a quark is
02:16.94
and all of that.
02:18.09
And the math can get pretty hairy.
02:20.347
But I just want to give you an example
02:21.93
of what the weak interaction does.
02:23.346
So if one of these neutrons turns into a proton,
02:26.63
then we're going to have one extra proton.
02:28.815
But we're going to have the same number of nucleons.
02:31.93
Instead of an extra neutron here,
02:34.37
you now have an extra proton here.
02:36.42
And so now this is a different atom.
02:38.26
It is now barium.
02:40.43
And in that flipping, it will actually
02:42.48
emit an electron and an anti-electron neutrino.
02:49.55
And I'm not going to go into the details of what
02:52.29
an anti-electron neutrino is.
02:54.67
These are fundamental particles.
02:56.43
But this is just what the weak interaction is.
02:58.69
It's not something that's completely obvious to us.
03:00.83
It's not the kind of this traditional things pulling
03:03.96
or pushing away from each other, like we
03:06.73
associate with the other forces.
03:09.964
Now, the next strongest force-- and just
03:11.63
to give a sense of how weak gravity
03:14.08
is even relative to the weak interaction,
03:18.02
the weak interaction is 10 to the 25th times
03:23.035
the strength of gravity.
03:26.78
And you might be saying, if this is so strong, how
03:29.08
come this does it operate on planets
03:30.89
or us relative to the Earth?
03:35.47
Why doesn't this apply to intergalactic distances
03:38.902
the way gravity does?
03:39.776
And the reason is the weak interaction really applies
03:43.31
to very small distances, very, very small distances.
03:50.1
So it can be much stronger than gravity,
03:53.28
but only over very, very-- and it really
03:55.38
only applies on the subatomic scale.
03:57.52
You go anything beyond that, it kind of
03:59.69
disappears as an actual force, as an actual interaction.
04:03.87
Now, the next force up the hierarchy,
04:07.43
which is one that we are more familiar with,
04:10.53
it's what actually dominates most of the chemistry
04:13.54
that we deal with and electromagnetism
04:16.76
that we deal with, and that's the electromagnetic force.
04:19.975
Let me write it in magenta, electromagnetic force.
04:29.82
And just to give a sense, this is 10 to the 36 times
04:34.541
the strength of gravity.
04:38.082
So it kind of puts the weak force in its place.
04:40.04
It's 10 to the 12th times stronger than the weak force.
04:42.54
So these are huge numbers that we're
04:44.04
talking about, either this relative to that
04:45.831
or even this relative to gravity.
04:48.539
And so you might be saying, well, you
04:50.08
know the electromagnetic force, that's unbelievably strong.
04:53.15
Why doesn't that apply over these kind of macro scales
04:58.89
like gravity?
04:59.79
Let me write it there, macro scales.
05:03.31
Why doesn't it apply to macro scales?
05:05.17
And there's nothing about the electromagnetic force, why
05:08.595
it can't, or it actually does apply over large distances.
05:12.83
The reality though, is you don't have these huge concentrations
05:16.55
of either Coulomb charges or magnetism the way you do mass.
05:23.83
So the mass that you have such huge concentrations,
05:26.31
it can operate over huge, huge distances,
05:28.69
even though it's way, way, way weaker
05:31.45
than the electromagnetic force.
05:32.85
The electromagnetic force, what happens
05:34.65
is because it's both attractive and repulsive,
05:37.74
it tends to kind of sort itself out.
05:39.44
So you don't have these huge, huge, huge concentrations
05:41.97
of charge.
05:42.93
Now, the other thing you might be wondering about
05:44.971
is, why is it called the electromagnetic force?
05:47.82
In our everyday life, there's things like the Coulomb force
05:52.13
or the electrostatic force, which we're familiar with.
05:55.74
Positive charges or like charges want
05:58.81
to repel-- if both of these were negative,
06:00.81
the same thing would be happening--
06:02.28
and different charges like to attract.
06:06.17
We've seen this multiple times.
06:07.5
This is the Coulomb force or the electrostatic force.
06:13.22
And then on the other side of the word, I guess,
06:16.24
you have the magnetic part.
06:17.72
And magnets, you've played with magnets on your fridge.
06:21.71
If they're the same side of the magnet,
06:23.85
they're going to repel each other.
06:25.364
If they're the opposite sides, opposite poles,
06:27.28
they're going to attract each other.
06:28.78
So why is it called one force?
06:30.332
And it's called one force-- and once again, I'm
06:32.29
not going to go into detail here-- it's
06:34.97
called one force because it turns out,
06:37.67
that the Coulomb force, the electrostatic force
06:41.18
and magnetic force are actually the same thing viewed
06:44.21
in different frames of references.
06:46.922
So I won't go into a lot of detail.
06:48.38
But just keep that in the back of your mind, that they
06:49.88
are connected.
06:50.52
And in a future video, I'll go more
06:51.978
into the intuition of how they are connected.
06:54.33
And it's more apparent when the charges are moving
07:00.8
at relativistic frames and you have-- well,
07:03.55
I won't go into a lot of detail there.
07:05.35
But just keep in mind that they really
07:06.933
are the same force, just viewed from different frames
07:10.06
of reference.
07:11.01
Now, the strongest of the force is probably
07:13.06
the best named of them all.
07:15.48
And that's the strong force.
07:18.77
That is the strong force.
07:24.34
And although you probably haven't seen this yet
07:26.67
in chemistry classes, it actually
07:28.32
applies very strongly in chemistry.
07:30.04
Because from the get-go, when you first learn about atoms--
07:34.45
let me draw a helium atom.
07:35.58
A helium atom has two protons in its nucleus
07:42.35
and it has two neutrons.
07:45.38
And then it also has two electrons circulating around.
07:47.92
So it has an electron.
07:48.85
And I could draw the electron as much smaller.
07:50.89
Well, I won't try to do anything in relative size.
07:53.89
But it has two electrons floating around.
07:55.83
And one question that may or may not have jumped into your mind
07:58.73
when you first saw this model of an atom
08:01.61
is like, well, I see why the electrons are
08:04.29
attracted to the nucleus.
08:05.78
It has a negative Coulomb charge.
08:07.68
The nucleus has a net positive Coulomb charge.
08:10.57
But what's not so obvious and what
08:12.14
tends not to sometimes be explained in chemistry class
08:14.79
is these two positive charges are
08:16.41
sitting right next to each other.
08:17.97
If the electromagnetic force was the only force in play,
08:21.257
if the Coulomb force was the only thing happening,
08:23.34
these guys would just run away from each other.
08:26.28
They could repel each other.
08:27.874
And so the only reason why they're
08:29.29
able to stick to each other is that there's
08:31.68
an even stronger force than the electromagnetic force
08:34.73
operating at these very, very, very small distances.
08:37.9
So if you get two of these protons close enough together,
08:42.
and the strong force only applies over very, very, very
08:45.09
small distances, subatomic or I should even
08:47.76
say subnucleic distances, then the strong interaction
08:52.48
comes into play.
08:53.46
So then you have the strong interaction actually keeping
08:56.36
these charges together.
08:57.88
And once again, just to keep it in mind relative to gravity,
09:02.1
it is 10 to the 38th times the strength of gravity.
09:09.1
Or it's about 100 times stronger than the electromagnetic force.
09:12.505
So once again, the reason why you
09:13.88
don't see the strong force, which
09:15.71
is the strongest of all the forces,
09:17.36
or the weak interaction, applying over huge scales
09:20.31
is that their strength dies off super, super fast.
09:24.7
Even when you start going to a larger radius nucleuses
09:28.63
of atoms, the strength starts to die off,
09:30.92
especially for the strong force.
09:32.674
The reason why you don't see the electromagnetic force operating
09:35.34
over large distances, even though in theory it can,
09:38.05
like gravity, is that you don't see
09:40.23
the type of charge concentrations the way
09:42.37
you see mass concentrations in the universe.
09:45.13
Because the charge concentrations
09:46.82
tend to sort them out.
09:47.917
They start to equalize.
09:52.21
If I have a huge positive charge there
09:55.02
and a huge negative charge there,
09:57.13
they will attract each other and then become
10:00.89
essentially a big lump of neutral charge.
10:04.11
And once they're a big lump of neutral charge,
10:06.28
they won't interact with anything else.
10:08.1
And gravity, if you have one mass and another mass,
10:11.17
and they attract each other, then you
10:13.54
have another mass that's even better
10:15.04
to attracting at other masses.
10:17.48
And so it'll keep attracting things to it.
10:19.81
So it kind of snowballs the process.
10:21.69
And that's why gravity operates on these really, really
10:24.44
large, large objects in our universe
10:26.71
and on the universe as a whole.
10:29.29
