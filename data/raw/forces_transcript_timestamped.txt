00:00.03
what I want to do in this video is give
00:01.829
a very high-level overview of the four
00:04.02
fundamental forces four fundamental
00:07.62
forces of the universe and I'm going to
00:09.54
start with gravity I'm going to start
00:12.719
with gravity and it might surprise some
00:15.57
of you that gravity is actually the
00:17.43
weakest of the four fundamental forces
00:19.32
that's surprising because you say wow
00:21.3
that's what keeps us glued not glued but
00:23.76
it keeps us from jumping off the planet
00:25.65
it's what keeps the moon in orbit around
00:27.24
the earth the earth in orbit around the
00:29.55
Sun the Sun in orbit around the the
00:33.18
center of the Milky Way galaxy so it's
00:35.43
it's a little bit surprising that it's
00:37.23
actually the weakest of the forces and
00:39.6
and that starts to make sense when you
00:42.809
actually think about things on maybe
00:44.28
more of a human scale or a molecular
00:46.14
scale or even an atomic scale even on a
00:48.149
human scale your computer monitor and
00:51.75
you have some type of gravitational
00:53.699
attraction but you don't notice it or
00:55.44
your cell phone and your wallet there's
00:57.39
gravitational attraction but you don't
00:58.92
see them being drawn to each other the
01:00.51
way you might see two magnets drawn to
01:03.39
each other or repelled from each other
01:04.739
and if you've got even a smaller scale
01:06.36
you'll see that it matters even less we
01:08.88
never even talk about gravity and
01:10.5
chemistry although the gravity is there
01:12.54
but at those scales the other forces
01:14.729
really really really start to dominate
01:16.68
so gravity's are weakest so if we move
01:19.74
up a little bit from that we get and
01:22.439
this is maybe the the hardest force for
01:25.29
us to visualize or at least the hardest
01:27.93
the least intuitive force for me is
01:30.36
actually the weak force the weak
01:33.509
sometimes called the weak interaction
01:37.47
and it's what's responsible for
01:39.71
radioactive decay in particular beta
01:42.03
minus and beta plus decay and just to
01:44.159
give you an example of the actual weak
01:46.56
interaction if I had some cesium 137 137
01:52.619
means it has 137 nucleons a nucleon is
01:56.549
either a proton or a neutron you add up
01:58.5
the protons and neutrons of cesium you
02:00.39
get 137 and it is cesium because it has
02:03.39
exactly 55 protons now the weak
02:07.799
interaction is what's responsible for
02:09.39
one of the neutrons
02:11.67
essentially one of its corks flipping
02:13.5
and turning into a proton and I'm not
02:15.21
going to go into detail of what a cork
02:16.53
is and all of that and the math can get
02:18.72
pretty hairy but I just want to give you
02:21.3
an example of what the weak interaction
02:22.89
does so if one of these one of these
02:24.78
neutrons turns into a proton then we're
02:26.88
going to have one extra proton but we
02:29.34
have the same number of nucleons instead
02:32.25
of a extra Neutron here you now have an
02:34.83
extra proton here and so now this is a
02:37.29
different atom it is now barium and in
02:40.77
that flipping it will actually emit
02:42.9
it'll actually emit an electron and an
02:47.48
anti-electron neutrino and I'm not going
02:50.04
to go into the details of what an
02:52.38
anti-electron neutrino is these are
02:54.959
fundamental particles but this is just
02:57.0
what that weak interaction is it's not
02:58.92
something that's completely obvious to
03:00.51
us it's not kind of this traditional
03:02.79
things pulling or pushing away from each
03:05.1
other like we would like we associate
03:07.08
with the other the other forces now the
03:10.08
next strongest force and just to give a
03:11.85
sense of how weak gravity is even
03:14.76
relative to the weak interaction the
03:18.12
weak interaction is 10 to the 25th times
03:22.38
the strength of gravity times the
03:25.62
strength of gravity and you might
03:27.12
anything if this is so strong how come
03:29.22
this doesn't operate on planets or us
03:31.32
relative to the earth or the reason you
03:35.1
know why doesn't this apply to
03:37.37
intergalactic distances the way gravity
03:39.48
does and the reason is the weak
03:41.01
interaction really applies to very small
03:44.16
distances very very small distances so
03:50.13
it can be much stronger than gravity but
03:53.34
only over very very and it really only
03:55.44
applies on the sub atomic scale you go
03:57.75
anything beyond that it kind of
03:59.67
disappears as an actual force as an
04:02.16
actual interaction now the next the next
04:04.739
force up the hierarchy which is one that
04:08.22
we are more familiar with it is
04:09.87
something it's what actually dominates
04:11.79
most of the chemistry that we deal with
04:14.19
and electromagnetism that we deal with
04:17.19
and that's the electro magnetic force we
04:20.25
write it in magenta electro
04:24.47
magnetic magnetic force and just to give
04:30.29
a sense this is this is 10 to the 36
04:34.28
times the strength of gravity 10 to 36
04:37.01
times the strength of gravity so it kind
04:38.6
of puts the weak force in its place it's
04:40.16
10 to the 12 times stronger than the
04:42.17
weak force so these are huge numbers
04:43.73
that we're talking about either this
04:44.81
relative that or even this relative to
04:47.12
gravity and so you might be saying well
04:49.82
you know the electromagnetic force
04:51.2
that's unbelievably strong why doesn't
04:53.48
that apply over over over these these
04:57.41
kind of macro scales like gravity let me
04:59.96
write there macro scales macro scales
05:03.26
why doesn't it apply to macro scales and
05:05.18
actually there's nothing about the
05:07.4
electromagnetic force why it can't it or
05:09.68
it actually does apply over large
05:12.11
distances the reality though is you
05:14.03
don't have these huge concentrations of
05:16.45
either electric Ullom charges or
05:20.59
magnetism the way you do mass so the
05:24.05
mass that you have such huge
05:25.37
concentrations it can operate over huge
05:27.77
huge distances even though it's way way
05:29.84
way weaker than the electromagnetic
05:32.6
force the electromagnetic force what
05:34.25
happens is because it's both attractive
05:36.11
and repulsive it tends to kind of sort
05:38.66
itself out so you don't have these huge
05:40.19
huge huge concentrations of charge now
05:43.04
the other thing you might be wondering
05:44.0
about is you know why is it called the
05:46.52
electromagnetic force in our everyday
05:48.169
life there's things like there's things
05:50.51
like the Coulomb force that or the
05:52.61
electrostatic force which we're familiar
05:55.1
with positive charges or like charges
05:58.46
want to repel if both of these were
06:00.29
negative the same thing would be
06:01.52
happening and different charges like to
06:04.64
attract we've seen this multiple times
06:07.37
this is the Coulomb force or the
06:09.08
electrostatic force electro static and
06:12.95
then on the other side of the word yes
06:16.13
you have the magnetic part and magnets
06:18.32
you know you have you've played with
06:19.73
magnets on your fridge they what's what
06:21.2
you know if they're the same side of the
06:23.419
magnet they're going to repel each other
06:25.19
if they're the opposite sides opposite
06:26.93
poles they're going to attract each
06:28.07
other so why is it called one force and
06:30.169
it's called one force and once again I'm
06:32.15
not going to go into detail here it's
06:34.94
called one force because it turns out
06:37.31
that the cool
06:38.51
force the electrostatic force and the
06:40.88
magnetic force are actually the same
06:42.89
thing viewed in different frames of
06:45.53
references so I won't go into a lot of
06:47.81
detail but just keep that in the back of
06:49.34
your mind that they are connected in a
06:50.69
future video I'll go more into the
06:52.19
intuition of how they are connected and
06:54.29
it deals with when what it's more
06:57.83
apparent when they're moving when the
06:59.96
charges are moving at relativistic
07:00.98
frames and you have well I will go to a
07:04.31
lot of detail there but just keep in
07:05.87
mind that they really are the same force
07:07.94
just viewed from different frames of
07:10.13
reference now the strongest of the force
07:12.47
is probably the best name of them all
07:15.02
and that's the strong force that is the
07:20.33
strong force the strong force and
07:24.17
although you probably haven't seen this
07:26.3
yet in our in chemistry classes it
07:28.1
actually applies very strongly in
07:29.6
chemistry because from the get-go when
07:31.55
you first learn when you first learn
07:33.74
about atoms let me draw a helium atom a
07:35.57
helium atom has two protons and it's
07:39.14
nucleus two protons in its nucleus and
07:42.08
it has two neutrons and then it also has
07:46.04
two electrons circulating around so it
07:47.96
has an electron and I can draw the
07:49.46
electrons is much smaller than well I
07:51.38
won't I won't try to do anything in
07:53.21
relative size but it has two electrons
07:54.71
floating around and one question that
07:56.81
may or may not have jumped into your
07:58.25
mind when you first saw this model of an
08:01.22
atom is like well I see why the
08:03.26
electrons are attracted to the nucleus
08:05.24
it has a negative Coulomb charge the
08:07.82
nucleus has a net positive Coulomb
08:09.77
charge but what's not so obvious and
08:11.75
that what tends not to sometimes be
08:13.34
explained in chemistry class is these
08:15.35
two positive charges are sitting right
08:16.88
next to each other if the
08:18.14
electromagnetic force was the only force
08:20.24
in play if the Coulomb force was the
08:22.28
only thing happening these guys would
08:24.11
just run away from each other they would
08:26.66
repel each other and so the only reason
08:28.82
why they're able to stick to each other
08:30.95
is that there's an even stronger force
08:33.14
than the electromagnetic force operating
08:35.24
at these very very very small distances
08:37.4
so if you get two of these protons close
08:40.97
enough together and the strong force
08:42.65
only applies over very very very small
08:45.62
distances subatomic I should even say
08:47.78
sub nucleic distances then
08:51.02
the strong interaction comes into play
08:53.089
so then you have the strong interaction
08:55.31
actually keeping these charges together
08:57.32
and once again just to keep it in in in
09:00.47
mind relative to gravity it is 10 to the
09:03.35
38th 10 38 times the strength times the
09:08.06
strength of gravity or it's about a
09:09.56
hundred times stronger than the
09:11.33
electromagnetic force so once again the
09:13.399
reason why you don't see the strong
09:15.08
force which is the strongest of all of
09:16.79
the forces or the weak interaction
09:18.44
applying over huge scales is that they
09:20.6
really only they only their strength
09:23.0
dies off super super fast even when you
09:25.07
start going to large radius nucleuses of
09:28.73
atoms they strength starts to die off
09:30.62
especially for the strong force the
09:32.87
reason why you don't see the
09:33.83
electromagnetic force operating over
09:35.48
large distances even though in theory it
09:37.52
can like gravity is that you don't see
09:40.13
the type of charge concentrations the
09:42.2
way you see mass concentrations in the
09:44.66
universe because the charge
09:45.62
concentrations tend to sort them out
09:47.81
they start to equalize if I have if I
09:50.42
have some if I have some positive a huge
09:53.87
positive charge there and a huge
09:55.339
negative charge there they will attract
09:58.64
each other and then become essentially a
10:01.579
big lump of neutral charge and once
10:04.31
they're a big lump of neutral charge
10:05.57
they won't they won't interact with
10:07.25
anything else in gravity if you have one
10:09.89
mass and another mass and they attract
10:11.75
each other then you have another mass
10:14.27
that's even better to attracting each
10:15.589
other at other masses and so it'll keep
10:17.99
attracting things to it so it kind of
10:20.149
snowballs the process and that's why
10:22.01
gravity can operates on these really
10:24.14
really large large objects in our
10:26.27
universe in the universe as a whole
10:29.74
