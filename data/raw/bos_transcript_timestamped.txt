00:00.52
Let's imagine we have a huge cloud
00:02.65
of hydrogen atoms floating in space.
00:05.47
Huge, and when I say huge cloud, huge both in distance
00:08.24
and in mass.
00:09.36
If you were to combine all of the hydrogen atoms,
00:11.72
it would just be this really, really massive thing.
00:15.
So you have this huge cloud.
00:16.83
Well, we know that gravity would make the atoms actually
00:20.51
attracted to each other.
00:21.65
It's-- we normally don't think about the gravity of atoms.
00:25.1
But it would slowly affect these atoms.
00:27.62
And they would slowly draw close to each other.
00:30.38
It would slowly condense.
00:31.63
They'd slowly move towards the center
00:34.64
of mass of all of the atoms.
00:37.65
They'd slowly move in.
00:39.18
So if we fast forward, this cloud's
00:42.86
going to get denser and denser.
00:46.712
And the hydrogen atoms are going to start
00:48.42
bumping into each other and rubbing up against each other
00:51.3
and interacting with each other.
00:53.28
And so it's going to get denser and denser and denser.
00:56.1
Now remember, it's a huge mass of hydrogen atoms.
00:58.43
So the temperature is going up.
01:03.4
And it'll-- they'll keep condensing.
01:05.43
They'll just keep condensing and condensing
01:07.87
until something really interesting happens.
01:09.98
So let's imagine that they've gotten really dense here
01:12.677
in the center.
01:16.16
And there's a bunch of hydrogen atoms all over.
01:19.55
It's really dense.
01:20.31
I could never draw the actual number of atoms here.
01:22.6
This is really to give you an idea.
01:24.058
There's a huge amount of inward pressure from gravity,
01:28.026
from everything that wants to get
01:29.4
to that center of mass of our entire cloud.
01:32.54
The temperature here is approaching 10 million Kelvin.
01:38.9
And at that point, something neat happens.
01:40.78
And to kind of realize the neat thing that's happening,
01:43.68
let's remember what a hydrogen atom looks like.
01:46.39
A hydrogen-- and even more, I'm just
01:48.01
going to focus on the hydrogen nucleus.
01:49.39
So the hydrogen nucleus is a proton.
01:50.9
If you want to think about a hydrogen atom,
01:52.691
it also has an electron orbiting around or floating around.
01:57.2
And let's draw another hydrogen atom over here.
01:59.93
And obviously this distance isn't to scale.
02:02.05
This distance is also not to scale.
02:04.127
Atoms are actually-- the nucleus of atoms
02:05.835
are actually much, much, much, much smaller
02:07.98
than the actual radius of an atom.
02:10.199
And so is the electron.
02:11.29
But anyway, this just gives you an idea.
02:13.222
So we know from the Coulomb forces,
02:14.68
from electromagnetic forces, that these two positively
02:17.48
charged nucleuses will not want to get anywhere
02:20.97
near each other.
02:22.3
But we do know from our-- from what we learned about the four
02:25.52
forces-- that if they did get close enough to each other,
02:28.26
that if they did get-- if somehow under huge temperatures
02:31.54
and huge pressures you were able to get these two protons close
02:35.3
enough to each other, then all of a sudden,
02:37.21
the strong force will overtake.
02:39.13
It's much stronger than the Coulomb force.
02:41.79
And then these two hydrogens will actually--
02:43.8
these nucleuses would actually fuse-- or is it nuclei?
02:48.04
Well, anyway, they would actually fuse together.
02:50.75
And so that is what actually happens
02:53.57
once this gets hot and dense enough.
02:57.36
You now have enough pressure and enough temperature
02:59.83
to overcome the Coulomb force and bring
03:02.62
these protons close enough to each other for fusion
03:05.48
to occur, for fusion ignition.
03:12.186
And the reason why-- and I want to be very careful.
03:14.31
It's not ignition.
03:15.02
It's not combustion in the traditional sense.
03:16.894
It's not like you're burning a carbon molecule
03:20.91
in the presence of oxygen.
03:22.39
It's not combustion.
03:23.46
It's ignition.
03:24.085
And the reason why it's called ignition
03:25.71
is because when two of these protons,
03:27.88
or two of the nucleuses fuse, the resulting nucleus
03:32.76
has a slightly smaller mass.
03:35.064
And so in the first stage of this,
03:36.48
you actually have two protons under enough pressure--
03:42.12
obviously, this would not happen with just the Coulomb forces--
03:44.99
with enough pressure they get close enough.
03:46.781
And then the strong interaction actually keeps them together.
03:51.15
One of these guys degrades into a neutron.
03:56.83
And the resulting mass of the combined protons
03:59.46
is lower than the mass of each of the original.
04:01.86
By a little bit, but that little bit of mass
04:04.52
results in a lot of energy-- plus energy.
04:11.27
And this energy is why we call it ignition.
04:13.96
And so what this energy does is it provides
04:16.019
a little bit of outward pressure,
04:17.839
so that this thing doesn't keep collapsing.
04:21.42
So once you get pressure enough, the fusion occurs.
04:24.13
And then that energy provides outward pressure
04:26.26
to balance what is now a star.
04:30.88
So now we are at where we actually
04:32.66
have the ignition at the center.
04:35.8
We have-- and we still have all of the other molecules trying
04:39.05
to get in providing the pressure for this fusion ignition.
04:43.52
Now, what is the hydrogen being fused into?
04:46.3
Well, in the first step of the reaction-- and I'm just
04:50.58
kind of doing the most basic type of fusion that happens
04:54.64
in stars-- the hydrogen gets fused into deuterium.
05:00.02
I have trouble spelling.
05:01.442
Which is another way of calling heavy hydrogen.
05:03.4
This is still hydrogen because it
05:04.775
has one proton and one neutron now.
05:07.2
It is not helium yet.
05:08.1
This does not have two-- it does not have two protons.
05:12.29
But then the deuterium keeps fusing.
05:14.52
And then we eventually end up with helium.
05:19.01
And we can even see that on the periodic table.
05:21.1
Oh, I lost my periodic table.
05:22.48
Well, I'll show you the next video.
05:23.938
But we know hydrogen in its atomic state
05:30.04
has an atomic number of 1.
05:32.32
And it also has a mass of 1.
05:34.56
It only has one nucleon in its nucleus.
05:38.
But it's being fused.
05:39.08
It goes to hydrogen-2, which is deuterium,
05:42.21
which is one neutron, one proton in its nucleus, two nucleons.
05:46.59
And then that eventually gets fused--
05:48.35
and I'm not going into the detail of the reaction--
05:50.475
into helium.
05:51.32
And by definition, helium has two protons and two neutrons.
05:56.04
So it has-- or we're talking about helium-4,
05:58.28
in particular, that isotope of helium--
06:00.59
it has an atomic mass of 4.
06:03.35
And this process releases a ton of energy.
06:06.42
Because the atomic mass of the helium that gets produced
06:09.74
is slightly lower than four times the atomic mass
06:15.22
of each of the constituent hydrogens.
06:17.44
So all of this energy, all this energy from the fusion-- but it
06:21.74
needs super high pressure, super high temperatures to happen--
06:24.9
keeps the star from collapsing.
06:28.82
And once a star is in this stage,
06:31.51
once it is using hydrogen-- it is fusing hydrogen
06:35.346
in its core, where the pressure and the temperature
06:37.47
is the most, to form helium-- it is now in its main sequence.
06:41.35
This is now a main sequence star.
06:48.13
And that's actually where the sun is right now.
06:50.77
Now there's questions of, well, what if there just
06:53.58
wasn't enough mass to get to this level over here?
06:56.304
And there actually are things that
06:57.72
never get to quite that threshold
06:59.63
to fuse all the way into helium.
07:00.985
There are a few things that don't quite
07:02.61
make the threshold of stars that only fuse to this level.
07:05.09
So they are generating some of their heat.
07:06.839
Or there are even smaller objects
07:08.58
that just get to the point there's
07:10.28
a huge temperature and pressure, but fusion is not actually
07:13.6
occurring inside of the core.
07:15.042
And something like Jupiter would be an example.
07:17.
And you could go several masses above Jupiter
07:20.074
where you get something like that.
07:21.49
So you have to reach a certain threshold
07:23.156
where the mass, where the pressure and the temperature
07:25.47
due to the heavy mass, get so large that you
07:27.47
start this fusion.
07:28.77
And-- but the smaller you are above that threshold,
07:31.96
the slower the fusion will occur.
07:33.83
But if you're super massive, the fusion
07:35.57
will occur really, really fast.
07:37.68
So that's the general idea of just how stars get formed
07:40.7
and why they don't collapse on themselves
07:43.37
and why they are these kind of balls
07:45.64
of fusion reactions existing in the universe.
07:48.954
In the next few videos, we'll talk
07:50.37
about what happens once that hydrogen fuel in the core
07:54.12
starts to run out.
