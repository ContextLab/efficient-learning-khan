00:00.03
let's imagine we have a huge cloud of
00:02.399
hydrogen atoms floating in space Hugh
00:05.67
and I say huge cloud huge both in
00:07.44
distance and in mass if you were to
00:09.69
combine all of the hydrogen atoms it
00:11.79
would just be this really really massive
00:14.549
thing so you have this huge cloud well
00:16.92
we know that gravity would make the
00:19.17
atoms actually attracted to each other
00:21.42
instantly we normally don't think about
00:23.13
the gravity of atoms but it would slowly
00:25.949
affect these atoms and they'd slowly
00:28.199
draw close to each other it would slowly
00:30.779
condense they'd slowly they slowly move
00:33.63
towards the center of mass of all of the
00:36.329
atoms
00:36.84
they'd slowly move in and so if we fast
00:39.69
forward if we fast forward this cloud is
00:42.84
going to get denser and denser it's
00:45.3
going to get denser and denser and the
00:46.95
hydrogen atoms are going to start
00:48.329
bumping into each other and rubbing up
00:50.43
against each other and interacting with
00:52.199
each other and so it's going to get
00:53.94
denser and denser and denser and
00:56.07
remember was a huge mass of hydrogen
00:57.78
atoms so the temperature is going up the
01:00.539
temperature is going up and it'll
01:03.69
they'll keep condensing they'll just
01:05.76
keep condensing and condensing until
01:08.13
something really interesting happens so
01:09.99
let's imagine that they've gotten really
01:11.43
dense here in the center they've gotten
01:14.61
really dense here in the center and
01:16.14
there's a bunch of hydrogen atoms all
01:18.2
over it's really dense I could never
01:20.67
draw the actual number of atoms here
01:22.439
this is really give you an idea there's
01:23.64
a huge amount of inward pressure from
01:27.36
gravity from everything that wants to
01:29.1
get to that center of mass of our entire
01:31.71
cloud the temperature here the
01:34.049
temperature here is approaching 10
01:36.71
million Kelvin and at that point
01:39.54
something neat happens it to kind of
01:41.67
realize the neat thing that's happening
01:43.53
let's remember what a hydrogen atom
01:45.0
looks like a hydrogen and even more I'm
01:47.82
just going to focus on the hydrogen
01:48.96
nucleus so the hydrogen nucleus is a
01:50.34
proton if you want to think about a
01:51.479
hydrogen atom it also has an electron
01:53.72
orbiting around or floating around and
01:56.63
let's draw another hydrogen atom over
01:59.43
here and obviously this distance isn't
02:00.96
to scale this distance is also not to
02:03.42
scale atoms are actually the nucleus of
02:05.61
atoms are actually much much much much
02:07.2
smaller than the actual radius of an
02:09.929
atom and so is the electron but anyway
02:11.64
this just gives you an idea
02:12.94
so we know from the Coulomb forces from
02:14.77
electromagnetic forces that these two
02:16.72
positively charged nucleus is will not
02:19.27
want to get anywhere near each other but
02:22.33
we do know from ours from what we
02:24.67
learned about the four force is that if
02:26.05
they did get close enough to each other
02:27.79
that if they did get if somehow they're
02:29.92
under huge temperatures and huge
02:31.9
pressures you were able to get these two
02:34.3
protons close enough to each other then
02:36.61
all of a sudden the strong force will
02:38.38
overtake it's much stronger than the
02:40.63
Coulomb force and that these two
02:42.52
hydrogen's will actually these this
02:44.53
these nucleuses would actually fuse or
02:47.47
that nuclei well anyway they would
02:49.0
actually fuse together and so that is
02:51.46
what actually happens once this gets hot
02:55.48
and dense enough you now have enough
02:58.18
pressure enough temperature to overcome
03:00.67
the Coulomb force and bring these
03:02.74
protons close enough to each other for
03:04.87
fusion to occur for fusion fusion
03:09.66
ignition ignition and the reason why is
03:12.91
and I want to be very careful it's not
03:14.38
ignition it's not combustion in the
03:16.12
traditional sense it's not like you're
03:17.38
burning a carbon molecule with out in
03:21.459
the presence of oxygen it's not
03:22.69
combustion it's ignition and the reason
03:25.03
why it's called ignition is because when
03:26.17
two of these protons or two of the
03:28.33
nucleus is fuse the resulting the
03:31.66
resulting nucleus has a slightly smaller
03:33.88
mass and so in the first stage of this
03:36.34
you actually have you actually have two
03:38.44
protons two protons under enough
03:41.56
pressure obviously this would not happen
03:43.0
with just the Coulomb forces at with
03:45.13
enough pressure to get close enough and
03:46.36
then the strong interaction actually
03:48.09
actually keeps them together one of
03:51.37
these guys degrades in a neutron
03:53.08
degrades into a neutron and the
03:57.01
resulting mass of the combined protons
03:59.32
is lower than the mass of each of the
04:01.45
original by a little bit but that a
04:03.16
little bit of mass results in a lot of
04:05.44
energy plus plus energy and this energy
04:11.68
is why we call it ignition and so what
04:14.26
this energy does is it provides a little
04:16.239
bit of outward pressure so that this
04:18.31
thing doesn't keep keep collapsing so
04:21.43
once you get pressure enough the fusion
04:23.32
occurs and then that energy provides
04:25.3
outward pressure to
04:26.71
what is now a star what is now a star so
04:30.91
now we are at where we actually have the
04:32.949
ignition at the center we have and we
04:36.46
still have all of the other molecules
04:37.979
trying to get in providing the pressure
04:40.81
for this fusion ignition now what is the
04:44.56
hydrogen being fused into well on the
04:46.57
first step of the first step of the
04:49.15
reaction and I'm just kind of doing the
04:51.639
most basic type of fusion that exhibit
04:54.61
ours
04:55.15
the hydrogen gets fused into deuterium
04:58.0
deuterium of trouble spelling which is
05:01.81
another way of calling heavy hydrogen
05:03.16
this is still hydrogen because it has
05:04.75
one proton and one Neutron now it is not
05:07.479
helium yet it does not have two it does
05:10.27
not have two protons but then the
05:12.669
deuterium keeps fusing and then we
05:14.86
eventually end up with and then we end
05:18.16
up with helium and we can even see that
05:19.75
on the periodic table I lost my periodic
05:21.849
table well I'll show you in the next
05:22.99
video but we know hydrogen hydrogen
05:25.99
hydrogen in its atomic state has an
05:30.58
atomic number of one and it also has a
05:33.19
mass of one it only has one nucleon and
05:36.789
it's nucleus but it's being fused it
05:39.159
goes to hydrogen too which is deuterium
05:41.74
which is one Neutron one proton in its
05:44.979
nucleus two nucleons and then that
05:47.08
eventually gets fused and I'm not going
05:48.789
to the detail of the reaction into
05:50.32
helium and by definition helium has two
05:53.62
protons and two neutrons so it has or
05:56.65
we're talking about helium four in
05:58.33
particular that isotope of helium it has
06:00.82
an atomic mass of four and the whole
06:03.729
this process releases a ton of energy
06:05.83
because the atomic mass of the helium
06:08.56
that gets produced is slightly lower
06:10.84
than four of its of the atomic four
06:13.659
times the atomic mass of each of the
06:15.909
Constituent hydrogen's so all of this
06:18.19
energy all of this energy from the
06:20.8
fusion but it needs super high pressure
06:23.05
super high temperatures to happen keeps
06:25.15
keeps the star from collapsing and once
06:29.199
the star is in in this stage once it is
06:32.139
once it is using hydrogen it is fusing
06:35.11
hydrogen in its core where the pressure
06:36.849
and the temperatures of most to form
06:38.68
helium it is now in its main
06:40.81
sequence this is now a main sequence
06:42.22
star main main sequence star and that's
06:48.19
actually where the Sun is right now now
06:50.68
there's there's questions of well what
06:52.36
if what if there just wasn't enough mass
06:54.46
to get to this level over here and there
06:56.53
actually are things that never get to
06:58.33
that quite that threshold to fuse all
07:00.25
the way into helium there are a few
07:01.75
things that don't quite make the
07:02.77
threshold of stars that only fuse to
07:04.45
this level so they are generating some
07:05.98
of their eat or there are even smaller
07:07.54
objects that just get to the point
07:10.0
there's a huge temperature and pressure
07:12.04
but fusion is not actually occurring
07:13.93
inside of the core and something like
07:15.94
Jupiter would be an example and you can
07:17.41
go several several masses above Jupiter
07:20.44
where you get something like that so you
07:21.52
have to reach a certain threshold or the
07:22.84
mass where the pressure and the
07:24.94
temperature due to the heavy mass gets
07:26.65
so large that you start this fusion at
07:28.6
but the smaller you have above that
07:31.24
threshold this the slower the fusion
07:33.07
will occur but if you're supermassive
07:34.81
the fusion will occur really really fast
07:37.09
so that's a general idea of just how
07:39.28
stars get formed and why they don't
07:41.74
collapse on themselves and why they are
07:44.32
these kind of little balls of fusion
07:47.08
reactions existing in the universe and
07:48.94
the next few videos we'll talk about
07:50.44
what happens once that hydrogen fuel and
07:52.81
the cure in the core starts to run out
07:57.75
